# Personal-Brand-Development

Earlier this year, I was selected as Fall 2020 Fellow with [bespoken](https://www.letsbespoken.org), a mentorship program for womxn in music. 
My work as part of this mentorship program includes developing my own artistic personal brand as it related to my music, data science, and everything I do. An important first step to this was understanding and finding words to describe my current persona as I'm seen by those around me, and then use that to inform the artistic direction I want to move in. Data-driven decision making is at the core of what I do- both as a data scienitst and as a person! So, naturally, I chose to approach this personal branding project in the same way, and created an anonymous survey sent to a pool of friends, family, and colleagues in order to gain a better understanding of where I am today. This repository contains the results and analysis from that survey.


## The Survey

The survey I created was quite simple, distributed using Google Forms, and contained 3 main required questions.

  1) How would you describe my personality in 3 words?
  2) When is the last time you heard me play music?
  3) How would you describe my music, after hearing me perform in a concert or recital? What 3 words might you walk away with?
  
The survey was sent to 14 people consisting of family, friends, and people who I have worked with musically in the past, and had a 100% response rate.

While the words were the most important piece of feedback for me, the question on how long it has been since each survey-taker has heard me play was important, and could serve as a form of "weighting" the responses for added depth to the analysis.


## The Data

Because I designed the survey with the analysis in mind, the data was clean and minimal additional cleaning was needed. Mostly, I ensured each word was consistent (capitalized, no trailing or leading spaces), and that words were spelled correctly, etc. There was one word I had to manually correct, as it was written two different ways by two different people. 


## The Analysis

Two considerations were taken into account when looking at this data.

  1) Frequency: Are there certain common words that are being used by more people?
  2) Relevance: What are people who have heard me more recently saying in comparison to people who haven't heard me play for a few years? Are there any patterns           there?

This 2nd consideration was especially important, as I know that my personal branding two years ago isn't the same as it is now, and won't be the same in two more years! My personal brand is a reflection of who I am, and it continues to change and evolve as I do.

To visualize the most frequent words in botht the personality and music categories, I created the following word clouds.
